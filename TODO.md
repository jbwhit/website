# TODO

## Content

- [ ] Review and finalize About page bio
- [ ] Fix missing image in draft post (`posts/2024-09-08-teaching-and-learning-physics/images/inclined_plane_comparison.png`)
- [ ] Publish draft physics education post when ready (remove `draft: true` from frontmatter)

## Future Ideas

- [ ] Add an `articles/` section with per-series sidebar navigation for long-form writing (wait until I have multiple essays ready to publish)
- [ ] Explore gruvbox dark hard theme as a custom SCSS dark mode option
