There are libraries to do this kind of thing properly, but I wanted to see what a Decision Tree “sees” when it looks at an image.\nThe training input is each pixel’s x, y position, and the channel number. The target is the value for that pixel and channel. I am not doing a test/train split because I’m not looking to build a model to predict anything, I’m looking to compress something.\nAnd it worked. Here’s what it looks like for the black and white image:\n\n\n\nVan Gogh’s self portrait as seen by a decision tree.\n\n\nAnd if you want to see a video where I go through a bit more of an explanation check it out here:",

    "section": "The Cost/Benefit Tradeoff of Knowledge Retention",
    "text": "The Cost/Benefit Tradeoff of Knowledge Retention\nI wanted to have a good estimate of what the Cost/Benefit tradeoff looked like. If I wanted to retain 90% of my physics knowledge, was it closer to the optimistic or pessimistic curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cost Benefit Tradeoff\n\n\n\nIf it really was only 5 minutes of daily practice (optimistic curve) to maintain 90% of my physics knowledge and problem-solving skills, I’d easily commit to working on this while drinking my tea in the morning and keep myself 90% sharp. Conversely, if it required 47 minutes per day (pessimistic curve), realistically it wouldn’t be worth it.\nBut I didn’t have an answer to the question: What is the actual cost for maintaining different levels of knowledge?\nThis question is crucial because it directly impacts how we approach learning and knowledge retention. If the cost is low, we might be more inclined to maintain a broader range of knowledge. If it’s high, we might need to be more selective about what we choose to retain.\nThe efficiency of practice is another critical factor. If you could identify the skills that were about to leave your mind and get lost in the abyss*, you could potentially optimize your retention efforts.\n\n\n*The abyss is not real.\nI’ve studied numerous technologies and learning strategies over the years. I’ve used Anki, a popular SRS (Spaced-Repetition Software or Spaced-Retrieval System) program, for years. One of the best mental reframes that I’ve had about Anki comes from Michael Nielsen when he writes, “Anki makes memory a choice.” While Anki is a powerful tool, it’s not the focus of this post.\n\n\nAnki is a free program (the iOS app is not free) that makes remembering things easy.\n\nBecause it’s a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. – Anki website.",

    "section": "Adaptive Learning and Progress Tracking",
    "text": "Adaptive Learning and Progress Tracking\nOne of the most striking aspects of my MathAcademy experience has been its ability to adapt to my current knowledge level. I began with a diagnostic that identifies areas where I needed more practice, and areas that I already comfortably knew. After the diagnostic I was placed at something like 99% done with Foundations I, and 76% done with the Foundations II course. This personalized approach meant that I was always working at the edge of my abilities, maximizing my learning efficiency.\nThis point is important so I’ll state it another way. There are many free and high-quality math courses that exist on the internet right now. However, these lectures and videos are aimed at an audience that has a different background knowledge than me. There’s stuff that I already know, and probably things that the lecturer assumes that I know that I might not. So even with high quality courses, I have to spend significant time and effort in filtering the content so that I can actually get to the topics that are actually new to me (or look up something that I was supposed to have learned).\n\n\nIt’s even more cool than that. They’ve developed a way of giving partial credit to lower level skills if you’ve just demonstrated a skill that relies on it. As I understand it, for example, if you do a higher level problem that requires a lower level skill to complete, you get partial reinforcement for that lower level skill. For more details, see: this blog post on Fractional Implicit Repetition.\nFurther, they aren’t usually paired (as MathAcademy is) in a tight feedback loop with questions that test whether you could apply what you just learned. And finally, there is spaced-repetition built in, so it ensures that as your knowledge is elevated into the heavenly quintessence* before they fade away.\n\n\n*The heavenly quintessence is not real.\nOver my 40 hours of learning, I have completed the Mathematics Foundations II course. I’ve started Mathematics Foundations III, and again, a nice aspect of the site is that it gives an estimate of how many “experience points” it will take me to complete it. It, like Anki, turns a goal that I want to accomplish into something like “turn the effort-crank X times and you’ll have re-learned Linear Algebra to a deep level”.\nThis approach directly addresses the Cost/Benefit tradeoff we discussed earlier. By optimizing the learning process and providing clear metrics, MathAcademy helps minimize the “cost” side of the equation while maximizing the “benefit” through efficient, targeted learning.\nIt’s hard to give a good sense of how important that experience is. It’s a similar point that Rory Sutherland has made many times, including here, where he says that the innovation of Uber is not the calling of a cab, but in showing you a real-time map of where your cab is while it’s on your way to pick you up. The act of reducing uncertainty is a very big effect, but it’s hard to appreciate if you’ve just read about it. I think a similar thing is happening with MathAcademy (whether by accident or by design); you know how much effort or time it is until you’ve learned your next goal. It seems like a small thing, but it’s not, it’s really important. And I’ve noticed a number of these things that really make a difference to the student’s experience.",
