# [Solved] My Custom Domain keeps reverting on my GitHub Pages site

## The Setup

I used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) to create my website and a blog on a custom URL.

The whole process went rather smoothly. I had my website up and running, and I changed my hosting to point to the right place. My website appeared, and the DNS checks on GitHub's side all passed. I had my website on the custom URL and enforced HTTPS.

## The Problem

Whenever I made an update to my website, however, my URL broke. The GitHub pages page (github.io/jbwhit/...) worked, but the custom URL (jonathanwhitmore.com) just no longer pointed to the right spot.

## The Start of a Solution

When I first added my Custom Domain, GitHub helpfully created a CNAME (Canonical Name) file in the top level of the repo on the `gh-pages` branch (if that's what you're using, and I was).

Nbdev, however, uses the `nbs` folder as the top level of the website repo in the main branch.


## The Fix

All that I needed to do was to create a CNAME file and place it in the `nbs` folder, and then run `nbdev_prepare` and update as usual. I found that this completely solved the problem that occurred every single time I pushed a commit to github. 

```bash
# Directory structure of the GitHub website repo when using nbdev
├── ❌ CNAME           # <1>
├── nbs                # <2>
│  ├── _quarto.yml
│  ├── ✅ CNAME           # <3>
│  ├── sidebar.yml
│  └── styles.css
├── README.md
├── settings.ini
├── setup.py
```
1. ❌ This CNAME file is created by GitHub and placed in the root directory of your git repo (one level above the `nbs` directory that nbdev uses). The red X indicates this is not the correct location.
2. nbdev uses the `nbs` folder as the top-level of the website repo (this differs from what GitHub expects).
3. ✅ The correct place to put the CNAME file: under the `nbs` directory. The green checkmark indicates this is the proper location.
