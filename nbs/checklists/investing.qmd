**Purpose:** To systematically evaluate potential investments by assessing key financial, operational, and strategic factors.

**Background:** This checklist is inspired by a [tweet from @datarade](https://x.com/datarade/status/1808705176179462467) which shared an image of a checklist from a summary by [@sb9721p](https://x.com/sb9721p). It combines the investing wisdom of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Joel Greenblatt, Bruce Berkowitz, David Einhorn, Lou Simpson, Bill Ackman, Tom Murphy, and Michael Porter. I've expanded on this to create an actionable checklist with the help of [Claude](https://claude.ai) and Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/).
