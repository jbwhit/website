# Strategy Evaluation Worksheet
**For Analyzing Readings as Strategic Arguments**

---

## Purpose

This worksheet is designed for **diagnosis, critique, and falsification**â€”not construction. Apply it to:
- Strategic theory texts (analyzing the author's strategic argument)
- Historical case studies (evaluating the strategies described)
- Policy proposals or war plans within readings
- Your own application of concepts to current events

The worksheet is deliberately hostile to vague ambition and allergic to hand-waving. Many strategies collapse by Section 3.

---

## When to Use

**Year 1:** Use Sections 1-2 lightly as you build foundations
**Year 2:** Use Sections 1-5 rigorously once you have Gray, Schelling, and Allison
**Year 3:** Use the full worksheet

## SECTION 0: Claim Identification (Sanity Check)

**0.1 What is being proposed or argued?**

One sentence. No adjectives.

> "The strategy/argument proposes to ______ in order to ______."

*If you cannot write this cleanly, the strategy is not coherent.*

**0.2 Who is the strategic actor?**

(State, alliance, military, non-state actor, institution, orâ€”for theory textsâ€”the author making prescriptive claims)

**0.3 Who or what is the adversary or problem?**

*Be specific. "Instability," "terrorism," or "competition" are not actors.*

**0.4 What time horizon is assumed?**

- Short: 0-2 years
- Medium: 3-7 years  
- Long: 8+ years
- Unclear/Unstated

---

## SECTION 1: Ends (Political Purpose Test)

*Gray + Clausewitz: If the ends are wrong, everything else is irrelevant.*

**1.1 What is the stated political objective?**

*Not military tasks. Political outcomes.*

**1.2 Evaluate the objective:**

| Criterion | Yes/No/Partial | Evidence/Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Clear and defined | | |
| Stable over time | | |
| Politically legitimate domestically | | |
| Politically tolerable internationally | | |

**1.3 How will success be recognized?**

*Observable conditions, not intentions.*

**1.4 Is there goal inflation?**

*Ends expanding beyond original mandate?*

**1.5 What secondary political effects does success create?**

*New obligations, dependencies, expectations?*

### Failure Flags (Ends)
- [ ] Multiple incompatible ends
- [ ] Moral aspirations replacing political objectives
- [ ] "Shaping," "sending signals," or "restoring credibility" as ends
- [ ] Ends stated in terms of adversary behavior we cannot control

---

## SECTION 2: Ways (Causal Logic Test)

*Schelling + Sun Tzu: How exactly does action produce compliance?*

**2.1 What is the core causal mechanism?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Deterrence (preventing action through threat)
- [ ] Compellence (forcing action through pressure)
- [ ] Brute force (physically imposing outcomes)
- [ ] Persuasion (changing beliefs/preferences)
- [ ] Denial (preventing adversary capabilities)
- [ ] Attrition (exhausting adversary resources)
- [ ] Population control (COIN/hearts and minds)
- [ ] Institutional reform (building capacity)

**2.2 What must the adversary believe, fear, or value for this to work?**

**2.3 Is this consistent with what we know about the adversary?**

*Culture, ideology, regime type, incentives?*

**2.4 Where does the strategy assume voluntary cooperation?**

*From allies, local populations, bureaucracies, or adversaries?*

**2.5 What is the theory of victory?**

*How does tactical/operational success translate to political objectives?*

### Failure Flags (Ways)
- [ ] Magical thinking ("pressure will force reform")
- [ ] Assumed rationality without evidence
- [ ] Tactical activity substituted for causal logic
- [ ] No clear theory connecting military action to political outcome
- [ ] Relies on adversary making mistakes

---

## SECTION 3: Means (Capacity & Sustainability Test)

*Kennedy + Allison: Strategy fails when means are mismatched, misallocated, or politically unsustainable.*

**3.1 What resources are required?**

| Instrument | Required | Available | Sustainable | Politically Fundable |
|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Military | | | | |
| Economic | | | | |
| Diplomatic | | | | |
| Informational | | | | |
| Institutional capacity | | | | |

**3.2 What is the opportunity cost?**

*What cannot be done simultaneously?*

**3.3 Where does the strategy depend on organizational excellence?**

*Interagency coordination, partner competence, exceptional leadership?*

**3.4 Is there imperial overstretch risk?**

*Kennedy's question: Do means match ambitions over time?*

### Failure Flags (Means)
- [ ] Reliance on surge forces or exceptional leadership
- [ ] Underestimation of logistics, rotation, or fatigue
- [ ] Assumption that institutions will "adapt"
- [ ] Costs externalized to allies or future administrations
- [ ] Means adequate for initial phase but not sustainment

---

## SECTION 4: Risk (Explicit Failure Analysis)

*Gray + Betts: If risk isn't named, it's being hidden.*

**4.1 What are the top 3 failure modes?**

Be concrete:

1. 
2. 
3. 

**4.2 Which risks are acknowledged vs. ignored in the text?**

**4.3 What happens if the strategy partially succeeds?**

*Worst case: stalemate with sunk costs and no exit.*

**4.4 Is there clear exit or termination logic?**

**4.5 Who owns the risk politically if it fails?**

*Military, executive, legislature, alliance?*

### Failure Flags (Risk)
- [ ] No off-ramps
- [ ] "We will reassess" as risk mitigation
- [ ] Risk shifted silently to military or future leaders
- [ ] Success defined to exclude likely outcomes
- [ ] Escalation dynamics unaddressed

---

## SECTION 5: Implementation Realism (Friction Test)

*Clausewitz + Allison: Strategy does not survive contact with institutions.*

**5.1 Apply Allison's Three Models:**

| Model | What it predicts | Evidence in this case |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Model I: Rational Actor** | Strategy executes as designed | |
| **Model II: Organizational** | SOPs and routines distort execution | |
| **Model III: Governmental Politics** | Bureaucratic bargaining shapes outcomes | |

**5.2 Which bureaucratic actors must cooperate?**

*Identify veto players.*

**5.3 Where are incentives misaligned?**

**5.4 How does the strategy degrade under:**

- Delay?
- Partial compliance?
- Political turnover?
- Information gaps?

**5.5 What historical cases suggest this will go wrong in practice?**

### Failure Flags (Implementation)
- [ ] Assumes unity of effort
- [ ] Ignores interagency rivalry
- [ ] Treats execution as technical, not political
- [ ] Requires coordination that has historically failed
- [ ] Depends on information that won't be available

---

## SECTION 6: Adaptation (Enemy Gets a Vote)

*Kilcullen + Liang/Xiangsui: What happens after contact?*

**6.1 How can the adversary adapt cheaply?**

**6.2 Does adaptation favor the stronger or weaker side?**

**6.3 What incentives does the strategy create for the adversary?**

*Escalation, radicalization, delay, proxy warfare, horizontal escalation?*

**6.4 What would a smart adversary do after initial losses?**

**6.5 Is the strategy vulnerable to competitive adaptation?**

*Kilcullen's point: adversaries learn and adjust.*

### Failure Flags (Adaptation)
- [ ] Static model of conflict
- [ ] Underestimating adversary learning
- [ ] Confusing adaptation with progress
- [ ] No theory of how adversary responds to success
- [ ] Assumes adversary will cooperate with our timeline

---

## SECTION 7: Constraints (Ethics, Legitimacy, Civil-Military)

*Walzer + Huntington: Illegitimate strategies corrode themselves.*

**7.1 Does the strategy rely on morally questionable actions?**

*Torture, collective punishment, deception of public, civilian harm?*

**7.2 Ethical Assessment:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Jus ad bellum (just cause for war) | | |
| Jus in bello (conduct in war) | | |
| Proportionality | | |
| Discrimination (civilians vs. combatants) | | |

**7.3 What civil-military tensions does this create?**

*Huntington's question: Is the military being asked to do political work?*

**7.4 How does this affect long-term legitimacy?**

*Domestic and international?*

### Failure Flags (Constraints)
- [ ] Ethics treated as PR problem
- [ ] Military asked to absorb political risk
- [ ] Short-term gains undermining long-term authority
- [ ] Strategy requires actions that will delegitimize the actor
- [ ] Civil-military boundaries blurred

---

## SECTION 8: Verdict

**8.1 Overall Assessment:**

| Criterion | Rating (Strong/Adequate/Weak/Fatal) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Ends coherence | |
| Causal logic (Ways) | |
| Means adequacy | |
| Risk ownership | |
| Implementation realism | |
| Adaptation resilience | |
| Ethical/legitimacy constraints | |

**8.2 Primary reason for likely failure (one sentence):**

> "This strategy is likely to fail because ______."

**8.3 The Conditions Question:**

> "For this strategy to succeed, the following would have to be true: ______. These conditions are [realistic/questionable/unrealistic] because ______."

**8.4 If forced to proceed, what is the least bad version?**

*Not redesign. Damage control within the existing approach.*
