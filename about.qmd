I'm Jonathan Whitmore — a physicist and data scientist interested in machine learning, causal inference, effective learning systems, and investing.

I studied physics at UC San Diego, and have maintained the [UCSD Physics PhD Qualifying Exams archive](projects/physics-quals/index.qmd) since 2008.

I also make [generative art](https://www.jbwhitmoreart.com/) — algorithmic explorations of motion, form, and color. On [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JonathanWhitmore), I share educational videos, live coding sessions, and streams where I [work through math homework](./posts/2024-09-10-mathacademy/).

This site is where I write about topics I find interesting, share checklists and tools I've built, and occasionally misuse machine learning.
