I'm Jonathan Whitmore — a physicist and data scientist interested in machine learning, causal inference, effective learning systems, and investing.

I studied physics at UC San Diego, where I also taught and maintained the [Physics PhD Qualifying Exams archive](projects/physics-quals/index.qmd) since 2008.

This site is where I write about topics I find interesting, share checklists and tools I've built, and occasionally misuse machine learning.
